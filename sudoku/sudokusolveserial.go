		Solve the Sudoku puzzle as follows:
		1) mapper: find out potential numbers that can be filled for each unfilled column in each row by
			looking at the unfilled column from the perspective of the corresponding row, column and the bounded box
		2) reducer: scan through the row, column or bounding box and resolve the column value
		3) repeat step 1 and 2 as long as the number of unfilled reduces in each iteration
		4) If the unfilled Cells are not reducing anymore, do the following
			pick the Cell with the least number of potentials:
			fire multiple threads concurrently with each of these potentials filled in the Cell
			do this recursively.

			I.e. once a Cell is filled with a potential, a recursive call is made to solve function,
			which fills the next potential and so on. There can be only one of two outcomes at the top most level:
			(a) the Sudoku is solved
			(b) this combination is invalid, in which case, this guess is abandoned

			at intermediate levels, there can be one of two outcomes:
			(a) the Sudoku is partially solved, in which case, this guessing comtinues
			(b) this combination is invalid, in which case, this guess is abandoned
